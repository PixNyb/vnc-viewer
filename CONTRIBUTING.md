# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! In order to get started, please fork the repository and then clone it to your local machine. You can then create a new branch and make your changes. Once you are done, push your branch to your fork and open a pull request.

## Local Development

To get started with local development, the [Docker Compose](/docs/compose.md) example is a good place to start. This will allow you to run the authentication proxy locally and test your changes.
